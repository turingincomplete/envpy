Overview
--------

Python library for loading config from environment variables. Suitable
for implementing the config requirements of a 12-factor app:
https://12factor.net/config

Getting Started
---------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install use pip:

::

    $> pip install envpy

Requirements before installation: 
 - python3
 - pip3

Usage
~~~~~

.. code:: python

    """Basic usage script for envpy"""

    import envpy

    CONFIG = envpy.get_config({
        # This will raise an error if it cannot be found in the environment
        # because no default has been set.
        'SECRET_KEY': envpy.Schema(value_type=str),
        # This has a default value and as such won't raise an error if it cannot
        # be found in the environment. However, the value type is set to 'int'
        # which means that an error will be raised if a value is present in the
        # environment but cannot be parsed as an integer.
        'NUM_WORKERS': envpy.Schema(value_type=int, default=4),
    })

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print('Secret Key:', config['SECRET_KEY'])
        print('Number of workers:', config['NUM_WORKERS'])

Value Types
-----------

**str**

No parsing is applied and the string is returned directly from the
environment.

**int**

The value will be parsed as an integer. Must match:  ^[0-9]+$.

**float**

The value will be parsed as a float. Must match:  ^[0-9]+.[0-9]+$.

**bool**

The value will be parsed as a boolean. Must be one of the following:
 - "1" (True)
 - "0" (False)
 - "true" (True, case insensitive)
 - "false" (False, case insensitive)

Development
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project makes use of virtual environments to provision your
development environment. Once the following requirements have been met
further installation is managed automatically by the Makefile.

Requirements before provisioning:
 - python3
 - pip3
 - virtualenv
 - make

Usage
~~~~~

The following commands will create a virtual environment (if not already
present) for the application and will install the necessary dependencies
there before running the requested command.

Run the package:

::

    $> make

Run the unit tests:

::

    $> make test

Run the linter:

::

    $> make lint

Rebuild your virtual environment:

::

    $> make rebuild_venv
